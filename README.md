# Image-processing
This is Deep Learning and Neural Networks(coursera course) week 4 programming assignment. We have prepared 2 Layered and 4 Layered Neural Networks to classify CAT vs non Cat images. Several functions have been written in this code to calculate backpropagation and other calculations required to build a neural networks
Accuracy of 2 Layered model is 0.74
Accuracy 4 layered model is 0.8
